## Status of this document

This is a working draft. It is complete enough to implement a conforming validator of FBL documents and a host that reads and writes bodies through declared bindings, but individual constructs may still change before version 1.0. Sections and paragraphs marked *(informative)* explain intent and give guidance; everything else is *normative*.

FBL relies on constructs that DISL 0.2 defines: id strategies and ephemeral ids (DISL §11.5), findings and their source locations (DISL §8.6), derived elements (DISL §4.11) and the tool type's origin (`language.origin`, DISL §3.2). Where this document names one of them, DISL is the definition; FBL defines none of its own.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY** and **OPTIONAL** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174 when, and only when, they appear in bold capitals.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What FBL is

Many ADP tools do not own the file their model lives in. A C4 diagram's model is a Structurizr workspace, a mind map's is a Freeplane `.mm` file, a Databricks job's is a bundle resource file, and even ADP's own formats (the timeline's `.tml`, the causal loop diagram's `.cld`) are meant to be read and edited by hand beside ADP. DISL's persistence layer (DISL §11) describes something else: a DID definition that a writer regenerates canonically. Before FBL, every such tool declared a required persistence plugin, which is code, and code has to be written once for each of the four ADP hosts.

FBL, the Format Binding Language, declares instead how such a file maps to a tool type's model in **both directions**:

- which files a tool claims, and how a host routes a file to it;
- how the file is read into elements, relations and attribute values, tolerating whatever it cannot read;
- how every change to the model is written back as **named, minimal splices**, so that everything the change does not concern stays byte for byte as it was, and so that every edit has an exact undo;
- where the view data a user places (positions) is kept: in an `.adp` **registration** beside the file, never in the file;
- how several tool types read one file at once, and how a folder is read and watched as one subject;
- and, for the formats that are too intricate to declare, the **contract** a persistence plugin implements, so that plugins behave alike in every host.

### 1.2 How FBL is used *(informative)*

A tool engineer writes an FBL document, `*.fbl`, holding one or more named bindings, and points a tool type's specification at one of them:

```json
{ "persistence": { "format": "fbl", "binding": "timeline.fbl#timeline" } }
```

A host that opens a file first routes it to a binding (section 12), reads its registration if there is one (section 8), opens the body through the binding (sections 4 and 5) and builds the model the DISL specification describes. Every transaction the user commits is planned as splices (section 6), applied to the body's bytes and kept in the body's history for undo (section 7). Positions the user drags are written to the registration. Other tools can keep editing the body, and the host picks their changes up (section 7.3).

The same binding serves every host. The round-trip fixtures in `fixtures/` (section 15.3) are the shared test: a host that passes them reads and writes bodies the way every other host does.

### 1.3 Relation to DISL *(informative)*

| Concern | Defined by |
|---|---|
| Metamodel, notation, toolbox, constraints, behavior, layout of a tool type | DISL |
| Id strategies, derived ids, ephemeral (unstable) ids | DISL §11.5 (`persistence.ids`) |
| Findings, their severities, codes and source locations; the built-in findings `std.unparseable`, `std.unreadableEntry`, `std.missingId`, `std.duplicateId`, `std.pluginMissing` | DISL §8.6 |
| Derived elements, computed containment | DISL §4.11 |
| A tool type's origin, `<vendor>/<type>` | DISL §3.2 (`language.origin`) |
| A diagram stored as ADP's own definition file | DID |
| A model stored in a file or folder another tool owns | **FBL** |
| The `.adp` registration, view data of such a model, routing | **FBL** |

DISL's persistence layer names FBL with `format: "fbl"` and `binding` (DISL §11.2). With that format, DISL's writer settings (`files`, `indent`, `newline`, `ordering`, `precision` and the others DISL lists) do not apply: FBL writes by splices and keeps the file's own conventions.

### 1.4 Design principles

1. **The file is the model.** A body is the only store of its model. A host **MUST NOT** keep a second copy of the model anywhere (a cache is not a copy if it is rebuilt from the body).
2. **Touch only what changed.** A save without an edit writes the bytes that were read. An edit changes only the bytes of its splices.
3. **Every write can be undone exactly**, or is refused before it happens.
4. **Reading never fails** on content. What cannot be read becomes a finding; what is not bound is kept.
5. **One answer in every host.** Everything that decides bytes (spans, splices, formatting of new text) is specified here, so two hosts write the same bytes for the same edit.
6. **Declare what can be declared; contract the rest.** A format FBL cannot declare is read by a plugin, but everything around the plugin (routing, registration, history, drift) is still FBL's.

### 1.5 Non-goals

- FBL is not a general grammar formalism. It covers the five format families of section 4, which are the ones today's tools need (constitution principle V).
- FBL does not compute the model beyond reading it: which elements a view shows, derived elements and layouts are DISL's.
- FBL does not merge concurrent edits. A body is edited by one host at a time; changes from anywhere else arrive as external changes (section 7.3).

## 2. Foundations

### 2.1 The document

An FBL document is a JSON document (RFC 8259) encoded in UTF-8, validated by `fbl.schema.json#/$defs/Document`:

| Property   | Type                 | Description                                                    |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$schema`  | URI                  | Optional; the schema's `$id` with `#/$defs/Document`.          |
| `fbl`      | `"0.1"`              | Required. The FBL version the document is written in.          |
| `doc`      | Doc                  | Documentation, as in DISL §2.4.                                |
| `bindings` | map Name → Binding   | Required, at least one. Each binding is described in section 3. |

A document **MUST NOT** contain duplicate keys. Properties whose names start with `x-` are extension properties and are ignored by hosts that do not know them, as in DISL §2.8.

### 2.2 Names

A binding name and a rule name is a **Name**: a letter or underscore followed by letters, digits, underscores, dots or hyphens (`^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*$`). Rule names are unique within their binding. Attribute names and type references are DISL's (`SimpleId`, `TypeRef`).

### 2.3 Binding references

A binding is referenced as `<document>#<name>`: a URI reference to an FBL document, resolved against the referring document's own location, followed by `#` and the binding's name. `#<name>` alone refers to a binding in the same document. A DISL specification refers to a binding the same way from `persistence.binding` (DISL §11.2), or embeds a Binding object there.

### 2.4 CEL

Wherever FBL needs a condition or a computed value it uses CEL, as DISL does (DISL §2.5, §12), with the cost limits DISL sets. The variables available depend on where an expression appears:

| Variable       | Type                     | Available in                                   | Meaning |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `entry`        | map                      | rule `when`, slot `value`, sidecar `key`       | The entry the rule matched, as CEL values (section 4.1.4). |
| `parent`       | map or null              | same                                           | The nearest enclosing entry matched by any rule of the binding, or null. |
| `path`         | map string → string      | tree and xml rules                             | The values of the selector's `{capture}` segments (section 4.2). |
| `groups`       | map string → string      | lines and blocks rules                         | The named groups of the rule's `line` that took part in the match; a group that did not is absent, so `has(groups.x)` tests it. |
| `line`         | int                      | every rule                                     | The 1-based line on which the entry starts. |
| `registration` | map string → string      | every rule                                     | The headers of the registration the body was opened through (section 8), empty without one. |
| `attributes`   | map                      | `insert.when`                                  | The attribute values of the element being added. |

A CEL expression **MUST** compile against these variables; a validator reports one that does not.

### 2.5 Regular expressions

`lines` and `blocks` rules, markers, headers and comments use regular expressions in the **common subset** of RE2, .NET, Java and ECMAScript syntax, which all four hosts' languages and CEL's `matches` read alike:

- literals, `.`, character classes `[…]` and `[^…]`, the escapes `\d \D \s \S \w \W \t \n \r \\` and escaped punctuation;
- anchors `^` and `$` (a line never contains its line ending, so both refer to the line);
- groups `(…)`, non-capturing groups `(?:…)` and named groups `(?<name>…)`, names being SimpleIds;
- alternation `|` and the quantifiers `* + ? {n} {n,} {n,m}` and their lazy forms.

Backreferences, lookaround, atomic groups, possessive quantifiers, inline flags and Unicode property classes are not in the subset, and a validator **MUST** reject an expression that uses them. Case-insensitive matching of ASCII letters is requested with a rule's `caseInsensitive`. Matching is against the whole line unless the expression says otherwise with anchors; a match that could succeed in several ways takes the one the leftmost-first semantics of RE2 gives, which the other engines agree with for this subset.

### 2.6 Text

A body file is UTF-8, with or without a byte-order mark. A byte-order mark, if present, is kept and belongs to no node; offsets in this document and in fixtures are UTF-8 byte offsets into the file including it. A file that is not valid UTF-8 is an unreadable body (section 7.5). A **line** is a maximal run of bytes without CR or LF; its **line ending** is the CRLF, LF or lone CR that follows it, if any. Line and column numbers in findings are 1-based; columns count Unicode code points, as DISL §8.6 requires.

### 2.7 Versioning

`fbl` names the version of FBL a document is written in. A host **MUST** refuse a document whose major version it does not support, and **SHOULD** read a document of a newer minor version, ignoring what it does not know, with a warning. Before 1.0 any construct may change (constitution principle IV).

---

## 3. The binding

### 3.1 Overview

A **binding** declares how one format maps to a language's model. Every binding has the same parts:

```json
{
  "title": "Timeline Markup Language",
  "claims": { "extensions": [".tml"], "origins": ["generic/timeline"] },
  "body": { "kind": "file", "family": "yaml" },
  "reader": "declared",
  "text": { "newline": "crlf", "indent": 2, "finalNewline": true },
  "header": { "key": "timeline", "value": 1 },
  "elements": [ … ],
  "relations": [ … ],
  "registration": { … },
  "template": { "text": "timeline: 1\r\nelements: []\r\n" }
}
```

| Property       | Type                            | Description |
|----------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| `title`, `doc` | LocalizedText, Doc              | As in DISL. |
| `claims`       | Claims                          | Required. Which files the binding takes (section 12). |
| `body`         | Body                            | Required. A file of one family, or a folder (sections 4 and 10). |
| `reader`       | `"declared"` or PluginReader    | Required. `declared`: the rules of this binding read and write the body. A PluginReader: a persistence plugin does (section 11). |
| `readOnly`     | bool or LocalizedText           | The body is never written; a text is the reason a host shows. |
| `text`         | TextDefaults                    | Conventions for new text where the body gives no evidence (section 6.3). |
| `header`       | Header                          | A version or identity mark the body starts with (section 5.6). |
| `comment`      | Regex                           | `lines` and `blocks`: a line that matches it is a comment (section 4.6). |
| `unmatched`    | `"keep"` (default), `"report"`  | `lines` and `blocks`: whether a statement no rule matches is also reported (section 7.4). |
| `blocks`       | BlockRule[]                     | `blocks`: statements that open blocks and produce nothing (section 4.7). |
| `elements`     | ElementRule[]                   | Rules producing elements (section 5). |
| `relations`    | RelationRule[]                  | Rules producing relations (section 5.4). |
| `registration` | RegistrationSettings            | What the binding adds to the registration (section 8). |
| `template`     | Template                        | The bytes of a new body (section 13). |

A declared binding **MUST** have at least one element or relation rule. A binding with a plugin reader has no rules; its model is what the plugin reads.

### 3.2 The body

| Property    | Type                                   | Description |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| `kind`      | `"file"`, `"folder"`                   | Required. |
| `family`    | `"yaml"`, `"json"`, `"xml"`, `"lines"`, `"blocks"` | Required for a declared file body: the family whose lossless reading the rules address (section 4). |
| `alsoRead`  | family[]                               | Other families accepted for the same body. The host tries `family` first, then each of these in order, and uses the first under which the body is readable. A document read under another family keeps that family for writing. |
| `recognise`, `files`, `ignore`, `settle` | | Folder bodies only (section 10). |

### 3.3 The one-place rule

A value that can be written back **MUST** be bound to exactly one place in the body: a key, an XML attribute, the text of an element, a named group of a line, or a word of a group (section 5.2). A value bound only through CEL (`value`) is read-only. This is what makes write-back defined: FBL never inverts an expression.

### 3.4 Read-only bindings and rules

A binding with `readOnly` is never written: the host offers no gesture that changes the model, and says why when the user tries. A rule or an attribute binding with `readOnly` is read and never written; a gesture that would change it is refused with the rule's reason, or a host-chosen one when `readOnly` is `true`. Elements that DISL derives (DISL §4.11) are never written either.

---

## 4. Format families and their lossless readings

### 4.1 The common model

For each family, this section defines a **lossless reading**: a tree of nodes over the body's bytes in which every byte belongs to exactly one node or to the **trivia** (whitespace, comments, line endings) that one node owns. Rules (section 5) select nodes; splices (section 6) replace the spans of nodes. A host **MAY** parse a body however it likes, but the spans it uses **MUST** be the ones defined here.

#### 4.1.1 Entries and spans

An **entry** is a node that a rule can match: a mapping member or sequence item (yaml, json), an element (xml), a statement (lines, blocks). Every entry has:

- its **own span**: the bytes of the entry itself, from its first to its last significant byte;
- its **line span**, when the entry starts its line and ends its line (nothing but trivia before it on its first line and after it on its last): from the first byte of its first line to the end of the line ending of its last line, extended upwards over its **leading comments**, the comment lines directly above it at the same indentation with no blank line in between. A trailing comment on the entry's last line is part of its line span.

A **value** is a node that a slot binds: a scalar, a flow collection, an attribute value, the text of an element, a named group. Its span excludes quotes and delimiters for the purpose of reading, and includes them for the purpose of `replace-value` (section 6.1).

Blank lines belong to no entry: they are trivia of the enclosing container and are never removed or added by a splice unless this document says so.

#### 4.1.2 Unbound content

Everything no rule binds is **unbound**: unknown keys, attributes, elements and statements, comments, directives. Unbound content is read past, kept byte for byte, and moves only when a splice removes an entry that contains it (an unknown key inside a removed entry goes with the entry).

#### 4.1.3 Document order

Entries have **document order**, the order of their first bytes. Reading order is document order (DISL relies on it for `positionIn`); for a folder subject, files are read in the ordinal order of their relative paths, and document order within each.

#### 4.1.4 Entries as CEL values

An entry is presented to CEL (section 2.4) as follows. A yaml or json mapping is a map from key to value; a sequence is a list; a scalar is a string, int, double, bool or null by the YAML 1.2 core schema (JSON by its own types). An xml element is a map from attribute name to string, plus the key `text` holding its text content. A lines or blocks statement is presented as its `groups`.

### 4.2 Selectors

Tree rules (yaml, json) and xml rules select entries with a **selector**: segments separated by `/`.

| Segment        | Matches |
|----------------|---------|
| a key or name  | the member with that key (yaml, json) or the child element with that name (xml) |
| `*`            | any member of a mapping or any item of a sequence (yaml, json), any child element (xml) |
| `**`           | any number of levels, including none |
| `{name}`       | any member of a mapping, whose key is bound to `path.name` |
| `name[@A='v']` | xml: a child element with that name whose attribute `A` has the value `v` |

A selector that starts with `/` is absolute, from the document's root (the root mapping or sequence; the document element's parent in xml, so `/map` is the root element `map`). A selector without it is relative to the entry the rule is written for (in `insert.container`, `child`), or to the root elsewhere. `/` alone selects the root. A key containing `/`, `*`, `{` or `}` cannot be selected in FBL 0.1.

### 4.3 The `yaml` family

The body is a YAML 1.2 stream. Only the first document is bound; any further document is unbound. The lossless reading follows the YAML 1.2 syntax, with these definitions:

- A **block mapping entry** is a key and its value; its own span runs from the first byte of the key to the last byte of the value (for a block collection, its last entry's last byte). A **block sequence entry** is `-` and its value; its own span runs from the `-`.
- The **indentation** of an entry is the column of its first byte: the key, or the `-`. For a mapping that is a sequence item (`- id: a`), the mapping's entries are indented at the column of their keys (`id` at 4 in `  - id: a`).
- A **scalar value's** span is the scalar as written: with its quotes for quoted scalars; for a plain scalar, without trailing spaces or a comment; for a block scalar (`|`, `>` with indicators), from the indicator to the end of its last content line, without that line's ending.
- A **flow collection** (`[…]`, `{…}`) is one value. Its members are readable (CEL sees them), but its only writable span is the whole collection, written by `replace-value` in the style the attribute binding asks for (`flow` writes a one-line flow sequence).
- **Anchors, aliases, tags and merge keys** are read (an alias reads as the anchored value; a tag is ignored for typing when it is a core-schema tag and kept otherwise; `<<` merges as YAML 1.1 defines it, for reading only). A slot reached through an alias or a merge is read-only.
- A **YAML syntax error** makes the body unreadable (section 7.5). A document whose structure is well-formed YAML but not what a rule expects (a sequence item that is not a mapping, a scalar where a mapping is needed) yields unreadable entries (section 7.4), never an unreadable body.

### 4.4 The `json` family

The body is a JSON text (RFC 8259). Comments are not allowed: a body with a comment is unreadable. The nodes are objects, arrays, members, items and values, with these spans:

- A **member's** own span runs from the opening quote of its name to the last byte of its value; an **item's** from the first to the last byte of its value.
- A member or item **starts its line** when only whitespace precedes it on its line. The **separator** of an entry is the comma between it and the next entry of the same container.
- A string value's span includes its quotes.

A duplicate member name is read as a finding on the second and later occurrences (`std.duplicateId` is DISL's for ids; a duplicate key is `fbl.duplicate-key`), and only the first is bound.

### 4.5 The `xml` family

The body is an XML 1.0 document. The lossless reading keeps the prolog, comments, processing instructions and a document type declaration as unbound content; entity declarations are not processed, and a reference to an entity other than the five predefined ones and character references makes the containing element an unreadable entry. Nodes are elements, attributes and text:

- An **element's** own span runs from `<` of its start tag to `>` of its end tag, or of its tag when it is **self-closed** (`<x/>`).
- An **attribute's** value span is the text between its quotes; its own span runs from its name to its closing quote, and **attribute order is significant** (kept, and used for new attributes, section 6.3).
- An element's **text** is its character data with references decoded; a `text` slot's span is the character data between the start tag and the first child element or the end tag.
- Carriage returns are part of the content, not normalised: a reader that uses an XML parser **MUST** make it keep CR, since XML 1.0 normalises line endings and the body's bytes are the model.
- Escaping when writing: in text, `&`, `<` and `>` are escaped as `&amp;`, `&lt;` and `&gt;`; in attribute values also `"` as `&quot;`, LF as `&#xa;` and CR as `&#xd;`. Other characters are written literally in UTF-8.
- A `content: "html-paragraphs"` text slot reads the element's HTML body as plain text, one line per `<p>` element, whitespace inside a paragraph collapsed to single spaces; writing it emits one `<p>line</p>` per line with the escaping above.

### 4.6 The `lines` family

The body is a sequence of lines. Each line is exactly one of:

- **blank**: only whitespace;
- a **comment**: it matches the binding's `comment`; it is owned by the statement directly below it, if no blank line intervenes (a leading comment, section 4.1.1);
- a **statement**: any other line. A statement matched by a rule's `line` is an entry of that rule; the first rule in the binding's order whose `line` matches (and whose `when` holds) wins. A statement no rule matches is unbound (and reported when `unmatched` is `report`).

A statement's own span is the line without its ending; its line span adds its leading comments and its line ending. Its **values** are its named groups. A group used with `word` is split into **words**: runs of non-whitespace, where a run starting with `"` extends to the next `"` and includes both quotes. A `word` slot's value is the first word of the group that matches the slot's `word` expression; if that expression has a named group `value`, the value is that group, otherwise the whole word (without quotes when the word is quoted). A `flag` word slot's value is true when such a word is present.

### 4.7 The `blocks` family

The body is lines as in the `lines` family, with nesting: a statement whose last non-whitespace character, outside double-quoted strings, is `{` **opens a block**, which extends to the line whose only non-whitespace content is the matching `}`. A statement's entry then spans from its line to the end of the closing line. Blocks nest; braces inside double-quoted strings do not count. A body whose braces do not balance is unreadable.

`blocks` (BlockRule) name the statements that open a block and produce no element (`model {`, `views {`), so that rules can state where they apply:

| Property          | Type     | Description |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| `name`            | Name     | Required. |
| `line`            | Regex    | Required. The statement. |
| `within`          | Name[]   | The block rules or element rules whose block the statement must be directly inside; `^` is the top level. Absent: anywhere. |
| `caseInsensitive` | bool     | Match ignoring the case of ASCII letters. |
| `view`            | group name | The block defines a **view** of the body, named by this group's value. A registration's `view` header selects it (section 9.3). |

An element rule with `opens: true` may open a block (it may also appear on one line without one); `within` on element and relation rules works as for block rules. A statement is matched only by rules whose `within` admits its enclosing block.

---

## 5. Rules

### 5.1 Element rules

An element rule turns entries into elements of one node type:

| Property          | Type                        | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `name`            | Name                        | Required. Referenced by `parent`, `cascade`, `reference.to` and `within`. |
| `type`            | TypeRef                     | Required. The DISL node type produced. |
| `at`              | Selector                    | yaml, json, xml: where the entries are. |
| `line`            | Regex                       | lines, blocks: the statement. Exactly one of `at` and `line`. |
| `within`, `opens`, `caseInsensitive` | | blocks (section 4.7); `caseInsensitive` also for lines. |
| `files`           | Name[]                      | Folder subjects: the file rules whose files this rule reads (section 10). |
| `when`            | Expression                  | The entry is matched only when this holds. |
| `id`              | IdBinding                   | Where the element's id is stored (section 5.3). |
| `parent`          | `{rules, slot}`             | Containment (section 5.5). |
| `attributes`      | map attribute → AttributeBinding | Section 5.2. |
| `insert`          | Insert                      | How a new element is written (section 6.2). Absent: adding is refused. |
| `remove`          | Remove                      | How an element is removed (section 6.2). Absent: removing is refused. |
| `undo`            | `"inverse"` (default), `"snapshot"` | Section 7.1. |
| `readOnly`        | bool or LocalizedText       | Section 3.4. |

When several rules match the same entry, the first in the binding's order (elements before relations) whose `when` holds takes it; an entry becomes at most one element or relation. Rules of the same node type are how a type is written in several shapes (the timeline's `Period` and `Moment` are one kind of entry, told apart by `has(entry.end)`).

### 5.2 Slots and attribute bindings

A **slot** is exactly one place a value is read from and written to:

| Slot                     | Families          | The value |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| `{key}`                  | yaml, json        | The value of that member of the entry's mapping; with `child`, of the mapping the relative selector `child` reaches. |
| `{attribute}`            | xml               | The value of that attribute of the element, or of the element `child` selects. |
| `{text: true}`           | xml               | The text of the element, or of the element `child` selects. |
| `{group}`                | lines, blocks     | The named group; with `word` (and `flag`), a word of it (section 4.6). |
| `{parent: a}`            | all               | The value of attribute `a`'s slot in the enclosing entry the rule's `parent` names, or the nearest enclosing matched entry. Read-only unless that entry's slot is writable. |
| `{capture: c}`           | yaml, json, xml   | The key a `{c}` selector segment matched; writing it renames the key. |
| `{value: cel}`           | all               | Computed; read-only. |

An **attribute binding** is a slot bound to one DISL attribute of the rule's type, with these options:

| Property    | Values | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| `empty`     | `"remove"`, `"keep"`, `"refuse"` | Setting the attribute to its empty value (empty string, empty list, null) removes the slot (`remove-key`), writes the empty value (`keep`, the default for strings), or is refused. |
| `absent`    | map family → `"insert"`, `"refuse"` | Setting a value when the slot is absent from the entry: insert it (`insert-key`, the default) or refuse, per family. |
| `default`   | value | The value read when the slot is absent. |
| `number`    | `"shortest"`, `{decimals}` | How a number is written (section 6.3). |
| `time`      | `"keep-precision"` | A written date or date-time keeps the precision of the value it replaces (section 6.3). |
| `style`     | `plain`, `double`, `single`, `literal`, `flow` | yaml: the style of a newly written value, when the value it replaces gives none (section 6.3). |
| `reference` | `{to, by}` | The value names an entry of the rules `to` by the value of their attribute `by` (section 5.7). |
| `map`       | map wire value → model value | Translates values both ways. Several wire values may map to one model value; writing uses the first key in document order of the map whose value matches, unless the value being replaced already maps to it, in which case it is kept. |
| `override`  | Slot | A second slot that wins on read when present and is removed (`remove-key`) when the attribute is written. |
| `content`   | `"text"`, `"html-paragraphs"` | xml text slots (section 4.5). |
| `create`    | `{emit, place}` | xml: how a missing child element holding the value is written: `emit` with `{value}` as the placeholder, placed `first`, `last` or `{before: name}` among the element's children. Emptying the value removes the child with the line span it has (`remove-key`). |
| `readOnly`  | bool or LocalizedText | Section 3.4. |

An attribute of the node type that no binding names is not stored in the body: it takes its DISL default, or is derived as DISL says. A DISL attribute marked `fixed` (DISL §4.3) **MUST NOT** be bound.

### 5.3 Ids

How ids are made, derived and whether they are ephemeral is DISL's (`persistence.ids`, DISL §11.5). FBL says only where an id is stored, with the rule's `id`:

- `{"from": Slot}`: the id is the value of the slot. It is read from it, and written to it when the element is created (with a new id DISL's strategy generates, once, when the gesture happens, so a redo re-creates the element under the same id). A rename of the id is a `replace-value` plus the reference rewrites of section 5.7.
- `{"sidecar": {"key": cel}}`: the id is kept in the registration's `identities` block (section 8.6), keyed by the value of `key`, for formats whose entries have no id of their own (a Wardley map's components are named, not identified).
- No `id`: the id is the one DISL derives (`strategy: "derived"`), from the element's attributes and, through `self.location()`, its place in the file.

Ids that DISL marks **ephemeral** (an id that changes when the file is edited, such as one built from a line number) are never stored: not in a registration's layout (section 8.5), not in a sidecar. A missing or duplicate id is not a reason to refuse the body: DISL's `ids.missing` and its findings `std.missingId` and `std.duplicateId` decide, and an entry is always addressable by its place.

### 5.4 Relation rules

A relation rule is an element rule with two more slots, `source` and `target`, each **REQUIRED**. Their values reference the ends by id: an end whose value names no element is a **dangling reference**, reported as `fbl.dangling-reference` on the entry, and the relation is not created (DISL relations always have both ends). A relation whose ends are its enclosing entries takes them with `{parent: …}` (a Databricks dependency's target is the task whose `depends_on` it is in).

### 5.5 Containment

`parent: {rules, slot}` makes the element a child, in DISL containment slot `slot`, of the nearest enclosing entry matched by one of `rules`: the nearest ancestor node in the tree families and xml, the nearest enclosing block in `blocks`. A rule without `parent` produces top-level elements. Moving an element to another parent is a `remove-entry` in the old parent and an `insert-entry` in the new one, in one edit, keeping the entry's own bytes.

### 5.6 The header

`header` names a version or identity mark: a root `key` with a `value` (yaml, json), or a `line` expression the first statement or the root start tag must match (lines, blocks, xml). A body without the mark, or with another value, is read, and the difference is reported as `fbl.header-mismatch` (a warning). With `required: true`, a body without the mark is unreadable (section 7.5) instead. The header is never written except by the template.

### 5.7 References and rename

A slot is a **reference** when its attribute binding has `reference`, or when it is a relation's `source` or `target` (which reference ids). When the referenced value changes (the `by` attribute of an entry of the `to` rules, or an id stored with `from`), every reference to the old value is rewritten in the same edit, one `rewrite-reference` splice each. A reference inside a `word` or a list value is rewritten in place, word by word or item by item. A rename to a value another entry of the same rules already has is refused.

A group holding several references (a causal loop's members) is split into words, each a reference.

---
## 6. Writing

### 6.1 The splice catalogue

Every write is a **splice**: the replacement of one byte range of the body (possibly empty) with new text (possibly empty). Every splice is one of the eleven operations below, and every edit consists of such splices only. Each has an exact inverse: the splice that puts the replaced bytes back.

| Operation           | Replaces | With | Families |
|---------------------|----------|------|----------|
| `replace-value`     | a value's span, quotes included | the new value, in the value's own style when it fits (section 6.3) | all |
| `insert-key`        | nothing, at the position `insert.keys` or the attribute order gives | a new key and value (yaml, json), attribute (xml), optional segment or word (lines, blocks), or child element holding a value (xml `create`) | all |
| `remove-key`        | a key or attribute and the trivia it owns; a word and the whitespace before it; an `override` slot; a `create`d child | nothing | all |
| `insert-entry`      | nothing, at the place `insert.place` gives | a new entry with its separators and line endings | all |
| `remove-entry`      | an entry's line span, or its own span and one separator | nothing | all |
| `ensure-container`  | nothing, at the place `insert.create` gives | a missing container (a key with an empty block value, an array, an element) | yaml, json, xml; the registration's blocks |
| `remove-container`  | a container left empty and its line span | nothing | yaml, json, xml; the registration's blocks |
| `rewrite-reference` | a reference's span | the new value it names | all |
| `re-emit-line`      | a statement's own span | the statement emitted from its rule's `emit` with the element's current values | lines, blocks |
| `open-block`        | nothing, before the statement's line ending; and nothing, after the block's last line | ` {`; and a closing `}` line indented like the statement | blocks |
| `self-close`        | the `>` of a start tag and the end tag with the whitespace before it; or `/>` | `/>`; or `>` and a new end tag | xml |

A host **MUST NOT** write a body by any other means than these splices, except when the user explicitly replaces the body with the editor's own version after an external change (section 7.3).

### 6.2 Inserting and removing

**Insert.** A rule's `insert` says where a new entry goes:

| Property    | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `place`     | Required. `after-last`: right after the last entry of this rule in the container (document order); if there is none, at `end`. `end`: after the container's last entry. `start`: before its first entry. `last-child`: after the parent entry's last child (xml, blocks), opening the parent first when it is self-closed (`self-close`) or one-line (`open-block`). `next-sibling`: right after the entry the gesture was made on. `end-of-document`: after the last byte of the body. `{before: key}`: before the member `key` of the container. |
| `container` | Selector of the container (tree, xml), or the name of the enclosing block rule (blocks). Relative selectors resolve against the parent entry. `{capture}` segments resolve to the values the registration or the parent entry bound them to. |
| `create`    | When the container does not exist: `at` is `end-of-document`, `{before: key}` (before a member of the container's parent), `{after: key}` (right after a key of the entry, as the first key after it), or `{under: selector}` (at the end of that container); `text`, when given, is the container's own text, otherwise the key alone with an empty block value (yaml), `"key": []` (json) or an empty element (xml). One `ensure-container` splice. |
| `keys`      | The order of keys in a new entry (tree) or of its attributes (xml). A key the new entry has no value for is left out. |
| `emit`      | The text of a new entry for families without keys (lines, blocks, xml), and for json items written on one line: literal text with placeholders `{attribute}` (the attribute's written form, section 6.3), `{id}`, `{source}`, `{target}`; `[ … ]` encloses an optional segment, written only when every placeholder in it is non-empty. A `flag` attribute's placeholder writes the flag's word when true and nothing when false. |
| `skeleton`  | Fixed text written with the entry after its keys, indented as its keys (a Databricks task's `notebook_task`). |
| `when`      | An expression over `attributes`; when false, adding is refused. |

An insert is one `insert-entry` splice, preceded by an `ensure-container` splice at the same offset when the container is created. Splices at the same offset are applied in the order the edit lists them.

**Remove.** A rule's `remove` says what goes with an entry:

| Property    | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `cascade`   | Rules whose entries go too when they reference the removed entry (relations whose `source` or `target` is it, elements whose reference names it). Entries nested inside the removed entry's span go with it without being named. |
| `container` | `keep` (default): a container left empty stays. `remove-when-empty`: it is removed with a `remove-container` splice. |

A removal removes the entry's **line span** when the entry starts and ends its lines, else its own span. In json, removing an item also removes one separator: the one after it, or, for the last item, the one before it together with the whitespace between that separator and the item. Cascaded entries are removed bottom-up (last in document order first); all splices are one edit.

### 6.3 New text

New text follows the body's own conventions where the body shows them, and the binding's `text` defaults only where it does not. A host **MUST** apply these rules exactly; they are what makes two hosts write the same bytes.

**Line endings.** A splice that writes line breaks uses the ending of the line its insertion point is on, or, when that line has none (the last line without a final newline), the body's dominant ending (the one that ends the most lines; CRLF when CRLF and LF tie; a lone CR counts as neither). A body without any line ending uses `text.newline`, default LF. An insertion after a last line that has no ending writes the line break before the new text and none after it, so the body still has no final newline.

**Indentation.** A new entry is indented like its previous sibling in the container, or, when it has none, like its next sibling, or, when it has neither, one indentation step deeper than its parent entry. The step is the difference between the parent's and a child's indentation anywhere in the body, the first such pair in document order; else `text.indent` (default 2, or a tab). A new yaml sequence item under a key follows `text.sequenceIndent` when the body shows no example: `indented` (default) puts `-` one step deeper than the key, `flush` in the key's column. Keys of a new mapping item align with the column after `- `.

**yaml scalars.** A replaced value keeps its style (plain, single, double, literal, folded) when the new value can be written in it; else, and for a new value, the style is chosen in this order: the attribute's `style`; plain if **plain-safe**; else `text.quote` (default `double`). A string is plain-safe when it is not empty; has no leading or trailing whitespace; contains no line break or control character; does not start with any of ``- ? : , [ ] { } # & * ! | > ' " % @ ` ``; contains neither `: ` nor ` #` and does not end with `:`; and would be read back as the same string under the YAML 1.2 core schema and as a string under YAML 1.1 (so not `null`, `~`, `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `y`, `n` in any case, a number, or a date or date-time), unless the attribute's DISL type is the type it would read as. Double-quoted strings escape `\`, `"` and control characters (`\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\uXXXX`); single-quoted strings double `'`. A multi-line string with style `literal` is written `|-` with its lines indented one step deeper than its key. A list with style `flow` is written `[a, b]`, its items by the same rules; an empty list is `[]`.

**json values.** Strings are written with the escapes RFC 8785 uses; numbers as below; `true`, `false`, `null` as such. A new member of an object or item of an array that is written one per line starts on a new line indented like its sibling; one in a container written on one line (or given by `emit`) is written after `, ` on the same line. The separator of the previous last entry is written as part of the new entry's splice.

**Numbers.** With `number: "shortest"` (the default), an integer value is written without a fraction, and any other number as the shortest decimal representation that reads back as the same IEEE 754 double, in ECMAScript's `Number.prototype.toString` form (RFC 8785 §3.2.2.3). With `{decimals: n}`, the number is rounded to `n` decimals, halves away from zero, and trailing zeros and a trailing point are dropped.

**Times.** With `time: "keep-precision"`, a date or date-time replacing a value is written with the precision of the value it replaces: a date as `YYYY-MM-DD`; a date-time as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`, and with a fraction or an offset only if the replaced value had one. A new value is written in the precision the gesture gave it.

**xml.** New attributes are written in `insert.keys` order, then in the order of their binding; an attribute added to an existing element goes after its last attribute, preceded by one space. A new element goes on its own line when its previous sibling is on its own line, with that sibling's indentation. A self-closed tag is written `/>` without a space unless the element being replaced wrote one.

**lines and blocks.** A new statement is its rule's `emit` on its own line, indented (in `blocks`) one step deeper than its enclosing block's statement. A changed value is written by `replace-value` on its group's span. A value whose slot has no span in the statement (an absent optional group or word) is written by `insert-key` when the rule's `emit` places it after a present value and before nothing that must move, and otherwise by `re-emit-line`, which rewrites the statement in the canonical form its `emit` gives; unbound words of a re-emitted statement are lost, so a host **MUST** prefer `insert-key` when both are possible.

### 6.4 Edits

A user gesture, form commit, operation or quick fix is one DISL transaction (DISL §14.4). When the transaction commits, its model changes are **planned** as splices: each attribute set, element or relation added, removed or moved becomes the splices this section gives, in the order the transaction made them, then adjusted so that all offsets refer to the body before the edit. The result is one **edit**: its splices applied together, recorded together, undone together. If any change cannot be planned (no `insert`, no `remove`, a read-only slot, `empty: "refuse"`, an `absent` refusal, a duplicate on rename, a plugin's refusal), the whole transaction is rejected with that reason and rolled back, and nothing is written.

### 6.5 Determinism

For the same body, binding and edit, a conforming host **MUST** plan the same splices and write the same bytes. Offsets are UTF-8 byte offsets; splices of one edit do not overlap; splices at the same offset apply in the order listed.

### 6.6 Saving

A host writes a body when the user saves, or after every edit if the host saves automatically; either way what is written is the body's bytes after its edits. A body **MUST** be written atomically (a temporary file in the same folder, then moved into place), keeping the file's permissions. A body that is unreadable (section 7.5) or read-only is never written.

---

## 7. History and reading problems

### 7.1 Undo and redo

Each open body has one **history** of edits, shared by every reading of it (section 9). An edit records its splices, the bytes each replaced, and the digest of the whole body after it. Undo applies the inverse splices of the most recent edit; redo applies the edit's splices again. A new edit clears the redo stack.

A rule or edit with `undo: "snapshot"` records the whole body before the edit instead; its undo replaces the whole body with that snapshot, as one splice of the whole range under the operation of the edit's first splice. Snapshots are for edits whose inverse would be many splices, such as a removal cascading through a large file; the result is the same bytes either way.

### 7.2 Drift

Before applying an undo or a redo, the host **MUST** compare the body on disk (or in the host's buffer, when another editor in the same host holds it) with the bytes the history expects: for an undo, the body after the edit; for a redo, the body before it. When they differ, the body has **drifted**: the host **MUST** refuse the undo or redo with a reason ("The file has changed since this edit, so it cannot be undone."), **MUST NOT** write, and **SHOULD** offer to reload.

### 7.3 External changes

A host watches every open body. When a body changes from outside and the host has no unsaved edits for it, the host reads it again, applies the difference to every open reading (elements matched by id keep their view data), and clears the body's history. When the host has unsaved edits, it tells the user and offers two choices: reload (the unsaved edits are lost) or keep the editor's version, which writes the whole of the editor's bytes as one edit that can itself be undone. A reload that finds the body unreadable keeps the last readable model on screen, read-only, with the finding; a deleted body closes its readings.

### 7.4 Tolerant reading

Reading **MUST NOT** fail on the content of a body. Every entry a rule matches but cannot read (a missing required slot, a value that does not convert to the attribute's type, a sequence item that is not a mapping) is an **unreadable entry**: it is reported as DISL's `std.unreadableEntry` at its source location, it produces no element (or an element with the readable attributes, when the binding's language says so through DISL's tolerant loading), and its bytes are kept untouched. Other entries are read as usual.

FBL's own finding codes:

| Code                        | Severity | When |
|-----------------------------|----------|------|
| `fbl.unbound-statement`     | warning  | A `lines` or `blocks` statement no rule matches, when the binding's `unmatched` is `report`. |
| `fbl.dangling-reference`    | warning  | A reference or relation end names nothing (section 5.4). |
| `fbl.header-mismatch`       | warning  | The header is missing or has another value (section 5.6). |
| `fbl.duplicate-key`         | warning  | A json object or yaml mapping repeats a key; the first is bound. |
| `fbl.missing-body`          | error    | A registration's body does not exist (section 8.2). |
| `fbl.stale-view-data`       | info     | A registration stores view data for an id the body no longer has (section 8.5). |
| `fbl.unknown-header`        | info     | A registration has a header neither FBL nor the binding declares (section 8.1). |

Every finding carries a DISL source location: `file` relative to the subject with `/` separators (for a file body, the body's own name), and the line, column and length of the entry's own span. A finding about something that is not drawn uses DISL's `subject`.

### 7.5 The unreadable body

A body is **unreadable** when it is not valid UTF-8, when it is not well-formed in its family (a YAML or JSON syntax error, XML that is not well-formed, unbalanced braces), when a `required` header is missing, or when a plugin reports it unreadable. An unreadable body opens as an **empty, read-only** model with one finding, DISL's `std.unparseable`, located at the problem, which replaces all other findings. It is never written. For a file body the body is the **primary file**, and `std.unparseable` stops rule evaluation (DISL §8.6); a folder subject has no primary file (section 10.3).

---

## 8. The registration

### 8.1 The line form

A **registration** is a small text file, `*.adp`, that names what a document is and keeps the view data a user placed. It is UTF-8 lines:

```text
databricks/job
body: resources/nightly_ingest.yml
resource: nightly_ingest
layout:
  task:ingest: 0 0
  task:quality_gate: 260 0
```

1. **Line 1** is the **origin** of the tool type (`language.origin`, DISL §3.2), after a byte-order mark if there is one. A host finds the DISL specification with that origin, and through its `persistence.binding` the binding.
2. **Headers** follow, one per line, `key: value` (the first `: ` separates them; blank lines are skipped). FBL defines `body`, `view` and `resource`; a binding declares others in `registration.headers` (the SKOS reading's `language`). A header neither defines is kept and reported as `fbl.unknown-header`. The header region ends at the first line that is not a header.
3. **Blocks** follow the headers: `layout:` (section 8.3) and `identities:` (section 8.6), each a line holding only the block's name and colon, followed by its entries, each indented by two spaces (any whitespace is read), `<key>: <value>`, where the key is everything before the **last** `: ` of the line, so keys may contain `: `.

Anything after the blocks is kept as unbound content. `$defs/Registration` in `fbl.schema.json` describes the parsed form; the examples in `registrations/` validate against it.

### 8.2 Finding the body

`body` is a path relative to the registration's folder, `/`-separated. Without it, the body is the sibling file with the registration's base name and one of the binding's extensions (the first that exists, in the order of `claims.extensions`), or, for a folder binding, the folder the registration is in. A body that does not exist opens the document empty with `fbl.missing-body`, and nothing is written until the user points the registration at a file. A host **MUST NOT** follow a `body` outside the workspace without the user's consent (section 16).

`view` names which view of the body the document shows (section 9.3). `resource` selects one resource of a body that holds several: its value binds the selector capture the binding's `registration.resource.capture` names (a Databricks bundle file's job key); without the header, the first such entry in document order is used.

### 8.3 The layout block

`layout:` holds the positions the user placed, and only those: one entry per placed element, `<id>: <x> <y>`, the top-left corner of the element in the reading's canvas units. An element without an entry is placed by layout. Entries are:

- written in the ordinal order of their ids (byte order of the UTF-8 encoding);
- with numbers in `{decimals: 3}` form (section 6.3), so `120.5` and `640`;
- with the registration's own line ending by the rules of section 6.3.

Placing an element for the first time inserts its entry (`insert-entry`), creating `layout:` after the headers first when it is missing (`ensure-container`); moving it replaces its numbers (`replace-value`); undoing the first placement removes the entry, and the `layout:` line with the last entry (`remove-container`). Other view data (sizes, waypoints, label offsets) is not stored in FBL 0.1.

### 8.4 Writing the registration

A registration is written with the splice rules of section 6, so a user's hand edits, comments below the blocks and unknown headers survive. View changes write only the registration; model changes write only the body, except where one edit concerns both (a rename of a stored id moves its layout entry in the same edit, with splices in both files, undone together). A host creates a registration beside a body the first time the user places an element, when the binding's `registration.createOnFirstPlacement` is true, and refuses the placement with a reason otherwise; a registration created this way is `<origin>` then `body: <name>` when the body's base name differs from the registration's, with the body's dominant line ending.

### 8.5 Stale and ephemeral ids

A layout entry whose id is not in the model is **stale**: it is not applied to any other element, it is reported as `fbl.stale-view-data`, and it is removed at the next write of the registration, as part of that edit. A host **MUST NOT** store a position for an element whose id DISL marks ephemeral; dragging such an element moves it for the current session only, and the host tells the user why the position will not be kept. A layout entry found for an ephemeral id is ignored and reported by DISL's `std.ephemeralViewData` (DISL §11.5.3).

### 8.6 Identities

`identities:` holds ids for bindings whose rules use `id.sidecar` (section 5.3): one entry per element, `<natural key>: <id>`, where the natural key is the value of the rule's `sidecar.key` expression and the id is made by DISL's strategy the first time the element is read without one. Entries are written, ordered and pruned like layout entries. Two elements with the same natural key share nothing: the second is reported as DISL's `std.duplicateId` and gets an id that is not stored.

### 8.7 Legacy sidecars

Two sidecar files that hosts wrote before FBL are read, so existing documents keep their view data:

- `registration.legacyLayout`, such as `{base}.layout.json` for the C4 types: a JSON object keyed by view key, then by element id, each `{"x": …, "y": …}`. Positions of the registration's view are read from it when the registration has no `layout:` block, and written back to it, by json splices, as long as it exists; view keys are matched ignoring case.
- `registration.legacyIdentities`, such as `{base}.identities.json` for the Wardley map: a JSON object mapping a natural key to an id, read when the registration has no `identities:` block and written back to it while it exists.

A host **MUST NOT** create either file for a new document.

---

## 9. Several readings of one body

### 9.1 One open body

A **reading** is one tool type's view of a body. A host keeps one **open body** per pair of canonical body path (absolute, with the platform's case rules) and binding: its bytes, its lossless reading, its model, its findings and its history. Every reading of the body is a view of that open body: an edit made in any of them is planned and applied once, recorded in the one history, and shown in every other open reading without a reload. Undo in any reading undoes the most recent edit of the body, whichever reading made it.

### 9.2 One binding per body

Every reading of a body **MUST** use the same binding: the six C4 types name `structurizr.fbl#workspace`, the four W3C types `w3c-turtle.fbl#turtle`. A tool type whose specification names a different binding for a body that is already open **MUST** be opened read-only, with a reason, until the other readings close. A validator **SHOULD** warn when two specifications claim the same extension with different bindings and no marker tells them apart.

### 9.3 Per-reading view data

Each reading keeps its own view data in its own registration (one `.adp` per reading), so positions of a container view and of a context view of the same workspace never mix, and none is written into the body. The registration's `view` header selects which view of the body the reading shows, for bindings whose `blocks` define views (section 4.7), matched ignoring case; without it, the first view in document order of the kinds the reading's tool type shows. The view's content (which elements a view includes) is the reading's DISL viewpoint's, not FBL's.

### 9.4 Offering readings

When a host is asked which readings it offers for a body, it lists every installed tool type whose binding claims the body (section 12), and, for a binding with `claims.readings`, each reading in the order of `claims.origins`, those whose `suggest` matches first.

---

## 10. Folder subjects

### 10.1 Recognition

A body with `kind: "folder"` is a **folder subject**: the model is read from the files of a folder. `recognise` says which folders qualify: every glob in `all` matches at least one entry of the folder, at least one glob in `any` does (when `any` is given), and no glob in `none` does. Globs are relative to the folder, `/`-separated: `*` matches within one path segment, `**` any number of segments, `?` one character, `[…]` a character class. Matching is case-sensitive on case-sensitive file systems and case-insensitive on others.

### 10.2 Files

`files` lists **file rules**: a `name`, a `glob`, and the `family` the file is read in. A declared folder binding's rules name the file rules they read with `files`, and see each file's entries as if the file were a body of its own (selectors are absolute within the file). A folder with a plugin reader hands the selected files to the plugin (section 11). `ignore` globs are never read. A symbolic link or other reparse point **MUST NOT** be followed.

### 10.3 Reading, watching and diffing

A folder subject is read file by file, in the ordinal order of the files' relative paths. A file that cannot be read is reported as DISL's `std.unparseable` located at that file, and the rest of the folder is read: a folder subject has no primary file, so no single file stops rule evaluation. A folder that no longer satisfies `recognise`, or no longer exists, is an unreadable body.

While a folder subject is open, the host watches every file it read and the folders that `files` globs could add files to. After a change, the host waits until no further change has arrived for `settle` milliseconds (default 400), then reads the subject again once, however many files changed, and applies the difference to every open reading: elements whose ids survived keep their view data, new ones are placed by layout, removed ones disappear. Hosts honour `settle` as closely as their platform allows. A host **MAY** stop watching a folder too large to watch reasonably, and **MUST** then say so and read again on request.

### 10.4 Writing

A folder subject is read-only unless its binding declares writes for a file rule's files (rules with `insert` or writable attributes reading that file rule). Then each file is a body of its own for writing: splices, history, drift and atomic saves apply per file, and one edit may splice several files, undone together. The registration of a folder subject sits in the folder (or beside it, naming it with `body`).

---

## 11. Persistence plugins

### 11.1 Where a plugin sits

Some formats are too intricate to declare: projecting Turtle triples onto cards and rows, evaluating MSBuild with its imports and wildcards, parsing SPARQL. For them a binding's `reader` is a **persistence plugin**:

```json
{ "reader": { "plugin": "net.etalii.adp.w3c.turtle", "version": "^0.1.0" } }
```

The plugin is declared in the DISL specification's `plugins` with `provides: ["persistenceFormat"]` (DISL §13.1); `args` are validated against its declaration. Everything else in the binding is declared and done by the host exactly as for a declared reader: claims and routing, the registration, several readings, folder recognition and watching, templates, history, drift and saving. A format FBL can declare **SHOULD** be bound rather than read by a plugin.

### 11.2 Operations

A plugin implements these operations, stated as data exchanged so that each host binds them to its own plugin mechanism:

| Operation  | Receives | Delivers |
|------------|----------|----------|
| `read`     | The body's bytes (a file body), or for a folder subject the relative path and bytes of every file the file rules select; the binding's `args`. | The elements and relations: type, id, parent and slot, attribute values; for each, the source span of the entry and of every writable value (file, byte range); the findings, with source locations; and whether the body is unreadable as a whole. |
| `plan`     | The current bytes, the last `read` result, and one model change: add, set, remove or move an element or relation. | The splices that realise it, each `{operation, file, start, end, text}` with an operation from section 6.1; or a refusal with the sentence the host shows. |
| `template` | The new body's name and the template placeholders (section 13). | The bytes of a new body. Only asked when the binding has no `template.text`. |
| `watch`    | The last `read` result (folder subjects, optional). | The paths the reading depends on beyond the file rules; the host watches them too. |

### 11.3 What the host does

The host, not the plugin, applies splices to bytes and saves them atomically; keeps the history and undoes with inverse splices or snapshots; checks drift; watches the body and calls `read` again after external changes; stores view data in the registration; routes files; and shares one open body between readings. A plugin-backed body therefore behaves exactly as a declared one: byte-preserving writes, exact undo, drift refusal, several readings, folder subjects.

### 11.4 What the plugin must do

- `read` **MUST NOT** fail on content: problems are findings, and an unreadable body is reported as such (section 7).
- `read` and `plan` **MUST** be deterministic: the same bytes and change give the same result, in every host's implementation of the plugin.
- Splices from `plan` **MUST** change only the bytes the change concerns, **MUST** name their operation truthfully, and **MUST** follow the new-text rules of section 6.3 where they apply to the format.
- A plugin **MUST NOT** write files, keep its own undo history, or store view data. A read-only binding's plugin is never asked to `plan`.
- A plugin **MAY** report findings about anything in the body, with DISL's source location and `subject`; the host shows them like any other finding.

### 11.5 The formats expected to stay plugins *(informative)*

| Format | Tool types | Why a plugin |
|---|---|---|
| Turtle and N-Triples | W3C RDF, OWL, SHACL, SKOS | Terms span tokens, prefixes compress IRIs, and one IRI yields several elements; the projection is code. |
| SPARQL 1.1 | SPARQL query | A recursive grammar projected onto scopes; read-only. |
| `.sln`, `.slnx`, MSBuild projects | .NET dependency graph | Wildcards, imports and central package management are evaluated; read-only. |
| Ansible project folders | Ansible structure | YAML and INI inventories, task directives and role resolution; read-only. |
| Helm chart folders | Helm chart | Templates are scanned as lines, not YAML, and includes resolved; read-only. |
| Azure Pipelines template expansion | Azure DevOps pipeline | Following `template:` references and unwrapping `${{ }}` expressions is evaluation; the rest of the file could be declared. |

---
## 12. Routing

### 12.1 Claims

A binding's `claims` say which files it takes:

| Property           | Type                   | Description |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| `extensions`       | string[]               | Lowercase, with the dot (`.tml`, `.ttl`). Matched ignoring case. |
| `names`            | glob[]                 | File names claimed whatever their extension (`databricks.yml`, `Chart.yaml`). |
| `shared`           | bool                   | The extension belongs to many formats (`.yml`, `.json`). A shared binding **MUST** have a `marker` or be `registrationOnly`. |
| `marker`           | Marker                 | The opt-in mark a file needs before this binding claims it (section 12.2). |
| `registrationOnly` | bool                   | The binding never claims a bare file; the file opens only through a registration. |
| `suggest`          | `{contains}`           | Substrings of a body's first 64 KiB that make a host propose this binding (section 12.3). |
| `origins`          | string[]               | The origins of the tool types that share this binding; each is the `language.origin` of a specification whose persistence names it. |
| `readings`         | map origin → `{bare, suggest}` | For a shared binding: which reading a bare file opens as (`bare`, at most one) and what suggests each reading. |

### 12.2 Markers

A marker is one of: `{rootKey, value?}`, a root key a yaml or json body must have (with that value, if given); `{firstLine}`, a prefix the first line must start with, after a byte-order mark; `{pattern, lines?}`, an expression one of the first `lines` lines (default 20) must match. A host evaluates a marker on the body's bytes without reading it through the binding.

### 12.3 Routing a file

When the user opens a file that is not a registration, the host routes it:

1. The **candidates** are the bindings of installed tool types whose `names` match the file name, or whose `extensions` include its extension; a `registrationOnly` binding is not a candidate, and a `shared` one is a candidate only if its marker matches.
2. With one candidate, the file opens as it: as its `bare` reading when the binding has `readings`, or as its only tool type.
3. With several, the host offers them all and **MUST NOT** choose silently; with none, the file is not a diagram.

When the user opens a registration, line 1 decides the tool type (section 8.1). When the user asks to add a diagram for a file (a host's "Add" or "Open as"), the host **MAY** propose every binding whose `suggest` matches the file's content, first those whose reading's `suggest` matches; accepting one creates a registration. A host **MAY** also offer to add a binding's marker to a file that lacks it; it adds the marker only when the user agrees, as a splice (an `insert-key` of the root key after the last root key, or an inserted first line), which is one edit that can be undone.

### 12.4 Replacing `x-adp` routing keys *(informative)*

The routing keys today's definitions keep in `x-adp` map to claims: `claimsBareFiles` is `readings.<origin>.bare`; `sharedExtension` and `x-adp-shared-extension` are `shared`; `suggestWhenBodyContains` is `suggest.contains`; `documentExtensions` is `extensions`; `subject: folder` is `body.kind: "folder"`; `registrationHeaders` is `registration.headers`; `x-adp-origin` is DISL's `language.origin`.

---

## 13. Templates

A binding's `template` is the exact text of a new body. When the user creates a new document of a tool type:

1. The host chooses the text: `template.byOrigin[<origin>]` when present for the tool type, else `template.text`; with a plugin reader and no template, the plugin's `template` operation.
2. It replaces the placeholders, and nothing else: `{name}` (the new file's name), `{base}` (its base name), `{key}` (the base name with every character outside ASCII letters, digits and `_` replaced by `_`, leading and trailing `_` removed, `_` prefixed when it then starts with a digit, and `untitled` when nothing is left), and `{newid:<rule>}` (a new id made by DISL's strategy for that rule's type). `{` and `}` not forming a placeholder are literal.
3. It writes the file, and a registration when the binding is `registrationOnly` or the document needs one; it **MUST NOT** overwrite an existing file.

A template **MUST** read through its binding with no finding of severity warning or above; a validator that can read bindings checks it. The user's first edits are splices into the template's bytes like any others.

---

## 14. Processing model

### 14.1 Loading an FBL document

1. **Parse** the JSON; reject duplicate keys.
2. **Check the version**: `fbl` major version supported.
3. **Validate** against `fbl.schema.json#/$defs/Document`.
4. **Resolve names**: rule names unique within each binding; every rule named in `parent`, `cascade`, `reference.to`, `within` and `files` exists; every `type` names a type of the specification that uses the binding (checked when a DISL specification is loaded with it, DISL §14.1).
5. **Compile** every regular expression in the common subset (section 2.5) and every CEL expression in its context (section 2.4).
6. **Check** the rules: every writable attribute has exactly one slot (section 3.3); no `fixed` DISL attribute is bound; a `shared` claim has a marker or is `registrationOnly`; at most one reading is `bare`; a declared binding has a family and rules; a plugin reader's plugin is declared by the specification.

A validator reports every problem with the JSON Pointer of its location, a severity and a message, as DISL §14.1 does.

### 14.2 Opening a document

1. **Route** the file (section 12.3), or read the registration (section 8.1) and find the body (section 8.2).
2. **Open the body**: reuse the open body for this path and binding if there is one (section 9.1); otherwise read it through the binding's reader (sections 4, 5, 11), giving the model, the source spans and the findings.
3. **Build** the reading: DISL loads the model as it loads a definition (DISL §14.2), derives what it derives, evaluates constraints.
4. **Apply view data** from the registration's layout (section 8.3), reporting stale entries.

### 14.3 Editing

Each committed DISL transaction is planned as one edit (section 6.4), applied to the open body, recorded in its history, and shown in every reading. A view change (a placement) is an edit of the registration.

### 14.4 Saving and closing

Saving writes each changed file atomically (section 6.6). Closing the last reading of an open body releases it; its history goes with it.

---

## 15. Conformance

### 15.1 Conformance classes

| Class | Requirements |
|---|---|
| **FBL document** | Validates against `$defs/Document` and passes the checks of section 14.1 without errors. |
| **Validator** | Implements section 14.1 and reports problems with JSON Pointers; checks registrations against `$defs/Registration` and fixtures against `$defs/Fixture` and section 15.3. |
| **Host — declared** | Implements the lossless readings of the families it supports (section 4), rules (section 5), the splice catalogue and new-text rules (section 6), history and drift (section 7), the registration (section 8), several readings (section 9), routing and templates (sections 12, 13), and passes every fixture of the families it supports. It states which families it supports. |
| **Host — full** | Host — declared for all five families, plus folder subjects (section 10) and the plugin contract (section 11). |
| **Persistence plugin** | Meets section 11.4 for its format. |

A host that does not support a binding's family or plugin **MUST** open its documents read-only, if it can read them at all, and say why; this is DISL's rule for a missing required plugin (DISL §13.1).

### 15.2 Graceful degradation

A host that cannot watch files reads bodies on open and on request only, and says so. A host that cannot keep the registration (a read-only workspace) keeps positions for the session only, and says so. Nothing else in this document degrades: byte preservation, exact undo and drift refusal are required of every host.

### 15.3 Round-trip fixtures

`fixtures/<name>/fixture.json`, validated by `$defs/Fixture`, is a conformance test for hosts:

| Property  | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `binding` | The binding under test, relative to the fixture. |
| `input`   | The input body, a file beside the fixture, compared byte for byte (the repository keeps these files from line-ending conversion). |
| `read`    | What reading the input yields: `elements` (`id`, `type`), `findings` (`rule`, `line`), `unreadable`. |
| `steps`   | In order: an `edit` (add, set, remove, place, or save without change), an `undo` or a `redo`; the `splices` it must produce, as `{operation, start, end, text}` with UTF-8 byte offsets into the document before the step; the document after it (`expect`, or `expectFile`); `refused` with the reason when the edit must be refused and write nothing. |

A host passes a fixture when reading the input gives what `read` lists and every step produces exactly its splices and its document. The repository's validator checks every fixture's consistency: each step's splices turn the document before it into its `expect`, and back by their inverses; an undo returns the document the undone edit started from; a save and a refused edit change nothing. Undo steps list the inverse splices under the operation of the splice each inverts.

Together the fixtures exercise every operation of section 6.1.

---

## 16. Security and robustness

- **No code execution.** An FBL document contains no code but CEL and regular expressions. Persistence plugins are code and are installed through the explicit trust decision DISL §16 requires.
- **Regular expressions.** Hosts whose regular expression engine backtracks (.NET, Java, ECMAScript) **MUST** bound the time a match may take, or use a linear-time engine; an expression that exceeds the bound is a finding on the statement, not a hang.
- **Paths.** A registration's `body` and a folder subject's files are resolved within the workspace; a host **MUST NOT** read or write outside it, or follow symbolic links, without the user's consent.
- **Sizes.** Hosts **MUST** enforce limits on the size of a body they read and the number of entries they build, as DISL §16 requires for stored diagrams, and report a body over the limit as unreadable rather than read part of it silently.
- **Integrity of other tools' files.** A host never writes a body it could not read, never writes bytes outside an edit's splices, writes atomically, and refuses an undo on drift. These are what make it safe to point ADP at files other tools own.
- **Templates** are text; placeholders are replaced literally and never evaluated.

---

## 17. Today's diagram definitions *(informative)*

The 25 diagram definitions in `definitions/diagrams/` were written before FBL; 24 of them name a persistence plugin as their format and the timeline names DISL's `yaml`. Under FBL:

| Outcome | Definitions |
|---|---|
| A declared binding (15 plus the timeline) | timeline (`timeline.fbl`), dependency graph, functional decomposition graph, hype cycle graph, Databricks bundle, job (`databricks-job.fbl`) and pipeline (`databricks-pipeline.fbl`), causal loop diagram (`causal-loop-diagram.fbl`), Wardley map, mind map (`mindmap.fbl`), the six C4 types (`structurizr.fbl`) |
| A declared binding, with a plugin for part of its reading | Azure DevOps pipeline (template expansion) |
| A plugin reader under the contract (8) | the four W3C types (`w3c-turtle.fbl`), SPARQL query, .NET dependency graph, Ansible structure, Helm chart (`helm-chart.fbl`) |

The timeline's specification would then say:

```json
{
  "persistence": {
    "format": "fbl",
    "binding": "https://etalii.net/adp/fbl/examples/0.1/timeline.fbl#timeline",
    "ids": { "strategy": "uuid-v4", "encoding": "base36" },
    "view": { "store": [] }
  }
}
```

Rewriting the definitions to use FBL is follow-up work, as is implementing FBL in the hosts. The per-definition record is in the feature that introduced FBL, `specs/005-format-binding/inventory.md`.

## Appendix A — JSON Schema

The normative schema is [`fbl.schema.json`](fbl.schema.json) beside this document (JSON Schema draft 2020-12, `$id` `https://etalii.net/adp/fbl/schema/0.1/fbl.schema.json`). Its `$defs` are: `Document`, `Binding`, `Claims`, `Marker`, `Body`, `Family`, `FileRule`, `PluginReader`, `TextDefaults`, `Header`, `BlockRule`, `ElementRule`, `RelationRule`, `IdBinding`, `Slot`, `AttributeBinding`, `Insert`, `Remove`, `RegistrationSettings`, `Template`, `Registration`, `Splice`, `Fixture`, `Edit`, and the helpers `Name`, `BindingRef`, `Regex`, `Selector`. It references DISL's `Doc`, `LocalizedText`, `Expression` and `TypeRef`.

The examples beside this document are `timeline.fbl`, `databricks-job.fbl`, `databricks-pipeline.fbl`, `mindmap.fbl`, `causal-loop-diagram.fbl`, `structurizr.fbl`, `w3c-turtle.fbl` and `helm-chart.fbl`; registrations are in `registrations/` and round-trip fixtures in `fixtures/`. `python .github/scripts/validate-examples.py` validates them all.
